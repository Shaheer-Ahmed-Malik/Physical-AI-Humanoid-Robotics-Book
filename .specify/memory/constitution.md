# Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Scientific Accuracy
Scientific accuracy grounded in modern AI, robotics, and embodied intelligence research.

### II. Reader Engagement
Reader engagement through clear, accessible explanations without losing technical correctness.

### III. Conceptual Clarity
Conceptual clarity for non-experts while remaining credible for professionals.

### IV. Future-Focused Insight
Future-focused insight into real-world humanoid applications.

### V. Transparency and Reproducibility
Transparency and reproducibility for all factual claims.

## Key Standards

- **Citation Format**: APA or IEEE (consistent throughout).
- **Source Requirements**: Minimum 40% peer-reviewed sources (ICRA, IROS, NeurIPS, Nature Robotics, etc.). Industry whitepapers from recognized leaders (Boston Dynamics, Tesla, Figure, OpenAI, NVIDIA, Sanctuary) are permissible for covering cutting-edge developments.
- **Tone and Readability**: Maintain a professional yet accessible tone. Target a reading level of Flesch-Kincaid Grade 9–11.
- **Plagiarism**: Zero tolerance for plagiarism. All content must be original or properly attributed.
- **Simplification**: Complex topics must be simplified using illustrative examples, diagrams, and analogies.

## Constraints

- **Word Count**: Total manuscript length must be between 25,000 and 40,000 words.
- **Structure**: The book will consist of 10–14 chapters, each with clearly defined learning objectives.
- **Format**: All content must be authored in Docusaurus-compatible MDX files.
- **Assets**: All visuals and diagrams are to be stored in the `/static/img/` directory.
- **Deployment**: The project must build and deploy cleanly on GitHub Pages without errors.

## Success Criteria

- **Traceability**: All factual claims must be traceable to a reliable and cited source.
- **Content Quality**: The final work must be engaging and reader-friendly while preserving scientific and technical accuracy.
- **Verification**: The manuscript must pass both plagiarism and fact-checking reviews.
- **Narrative Cohesion**: All chapters must follow a logical and coherent narrative flow.
- **Educational Goal**: The book should provide readers with a solid foundational understanding of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.
- **Technical Integrity**: The Docusaurus site must build and deploy successfully.

## Governance

This constitution is the authoritative guide for the project. All work, including writing, code, and documentation, must adhere to these principles and standards. Amendments to this constitution require a documented proposal, review, and approval, after which the version number will be updated according to semantic versioning rules.
