# Physics Simulation, Collisions, and Gravity

Physics simulation is a crucial aspect of creating realistic digital twins. It allows us to accurately model how objects interact with each other in a virtual environment, including forces, collisions, and gravity.

In this section, we will explore the fundamental concepts of physics simulation in Gazebo and Unity. We will cover:

-   **Rigid Body Dynamics:** Understanding how forces and torques affect the motion of objects.
-   **Collision Detection and Response:** How simulators detect when objects touch and how they react to those contacts.
-   **Gravity:** Simulating the universal force that pulls objects towards each other.
-   **Material Properties:** How friction and restitution (bounciness) influence interactions.
-   **Optimization for Realism and Performance:** Balancing accuracy with the computational demands of complex simulations.
