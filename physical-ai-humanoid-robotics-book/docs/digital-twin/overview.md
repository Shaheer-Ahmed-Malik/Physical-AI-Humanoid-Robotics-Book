# Digital Twins with Gazebo & Unity

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical object or system. In robotics, digital twins are used to simulate the behavior of a robot in a virtual environment before deploying it in the real world.

In this chapter, we will learn how to use Gazebo and Unity to create digital twins of our humanoid robots. We will cover the following topics:

-   **Gazebo:** An open-source 3D robotics simulator that is widely used in the ROS community.
-   **Unity:** A powerful game engine that can be used to create high-fidelity simulations of robots and their environments.
-   **Connecting to ROS:** Learn how to connect your Gazebo or Unity simulation to a ROS 2 network.
