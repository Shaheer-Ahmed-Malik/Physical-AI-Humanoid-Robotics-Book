# Hardware Requirements

To follow along with the hands-on examples in this book, you will need access to a capable workstation and some optional hardware.

## Workstation Requirements

-   **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04
-   **Processor:** Intel Core i7 or equivalent
-   **Memory:** 32 GB RAM
-   **Graphics Card:** NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti or higher (for Isaac Sim)
-   **Storage:** 1 TB SSD

Alternatively, you can use a cloud-based workstation with similar specifications.

## Robotics Hardware (Optional)

While most of this book can be completed using simulations, you can also apply the concepts to real-world robots. Here are some of the robots that are compatible with the software and techniques covered in this book:

-   **Unitree Go2:** A quadruped robot that is great for learning about locomotion and navigation.
-   **Robotis OP3:** A humanoid robot that is a popular platform for research and education.
-   **Unitree G1:** A humanoid robot with advanced capabilities for manipulation and human-robot interaction.

## Sensors (Optional)

-   **Intel RealSense D435i/D455:** These depth cameras are used for perception and 3D reconstruction.
-   **Jetson Orin Nano/NX:** These embedded AI computing devices are used for running AI models on the robot.
