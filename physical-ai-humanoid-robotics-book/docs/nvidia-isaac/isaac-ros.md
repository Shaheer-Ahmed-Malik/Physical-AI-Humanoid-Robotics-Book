# Isaac ROS: VSLAM, Navigation, Depth Perception

Isaac ROS is a collection of hardware-accelerated packages for ROS 2 that leverage NVIDIA GPUs to deliver high-performance solutions for robotics applications. It provides optimized components for key robotics capabilities, including:

-   **VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping):** Enabling robots to build maps of their environment and localize themselves within those maps using visual sensor data. Isaac ROS offers highly optimized VSLAM algorithms that can run in real-time on NVIDIA hardware.
-   **Navigation:** Providing advanced navigation capabilities for robots, including global and local path planning, obstacle avoidance, and motion control. Isaac ROS integrates with ROS 2's Nav2 stack, offering GPU-accelerated modules for improved performance.
-   **Depth Perception:** Utilizing various depth sensors (e.g., stereo cameras, RGB-D cameras) to generate accurate depth information about the environment. Isaac ROS provides optimized pipelines for depth estimation, 3D reconstruction, and point cloud processing.
-   **Neural Network Inference:** Accelerating the execution of deep learning models for tasks like object detection, semantic segmentation, and pose estimation, which are crucial for robot perception.
