# The AI-Robot Brain with NVIDIA Isaac

NVIDIA Isaac is a powerful platform for accelerating the development and deployment of AI-powered robots. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools, SDKs, and a simulation environment (Isaac Sim) that enable developers to build, train, and test intelligent robots.

In this chapter, we will explore how NVIDIA Isaac can be used as the "brain" of our humanoid robots, covering:

-   **Isaac Sim:** A highly realistic robotics simulator for training and testing AI models.
-   **Isaac ROS:** A collection of ROS 2 packages accelerated by NVIDIA GPUs for perception and navigation tasks.
-   **AI Workflows:** How to leverage NVIDIA's AI technologies for tasks like visual perception, navigation, and manipulation in robotics.
