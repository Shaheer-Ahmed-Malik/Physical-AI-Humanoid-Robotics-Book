# Multi-Step Reasoning for Robotics Tasks

Robotics tasks in the real world often involve a sequence of actions, decisions, and observations, requiring a robot to perform multi-step reasoning. This goes beyond simple reactive behaviors, enabling robots to handle complex scenarios, recover from errors, and achieve long-term goals.

In this section, we will explore:

-   **Sequential Task Execution:** How robots execute a series of actions, where the outcome of one action influences the next.
-   **Decision-Making Under Uncertainty:** Strategies for robots to make choices when faced with incomplete or ambiguous information from their sensors.
-   **Error Detection and Recovery:** How VLA systems can identify when a planned action fails or produces an unexpected result, and how they can adapt or replan to achieve the original goal.
-   **Long-Term Goal Achievement:** Combining perception, language understanding, and planning to enable robots to pursue and accomplish complex tasks over extended periods.
-   **Hierarchical Planning:** Breaking down large, complex problems into smaller, more manageable sub-problems that can be solved sequentially or in parallel.
