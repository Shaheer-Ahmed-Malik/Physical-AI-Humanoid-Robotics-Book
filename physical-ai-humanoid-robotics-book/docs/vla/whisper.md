# Whisper for Voice-to-Action

OpenAI's Whisper is a versatile and robust speech-to-text model that can transcribe audio into text with high accuracy. When integrated into a VLA pipeline, Whisper acts as the auditory interface for robots, translating spoken human commands into a format that can be processed by language models for cognitive planning.

In this section, we will explore:

-   **Whisper Model Overview:** Understanding how Whisper works, its capabilities, and its performance across various languages and accents.
-   **Integration with Robotics:** How Whisper can be deployed on robotics platforms, either locally or via cloud APIs, to enable real-time speech recognition.
-   **Processing Spoken Commands:** Converting the raw speech-to-text output from Whisper into structured commands or prompts that can be fed into an LLM for further interpretation.
-   **Use Cases in Humanoid Robotics:** Examples of how humanoid robots can understand spoken instructions to perform tasks, answer questions, or engage in natural human-robot interaction.
