# ROS 2 Fundamentals

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. ROS 2 is the second generation of ROS, and it is designed to be more reliable, secure, and scalable than its predecessor.

In this chapter, we will cover the fundamental concepts of ROS 2, including:

-   **Nodes:** A node is a process that performs computation. In ROS 2, a robot is typically composed of many nodes that communicate with each other.
-   **Topics:** A topic is a named bus over which nodes exchange messages. Topics are used for one-way communication, where a publisher sends a message and a subscriber receives it.
-   **Services:** A service is a request/response communication pattern. A client sends a request to a server, and the server returns a response.
-   **Actions:** An action is a long-running, feedback-driven communication pattern. A client sends a goal to a server, and the server provides feedback on the progress of the goal and eventually returns a result.
