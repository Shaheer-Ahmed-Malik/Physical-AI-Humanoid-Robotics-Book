# Connecting Python Agents to ROS Controllers with rclpy

`rclpy` is the Python client library for ROS 2. It allows you to write ROS 2 nodes in Python and communicate with other nodes in the ROS 2 graph.

In this section, we will learn how to use `rclpy` to create a simple Python agent that can control a robot in a ROS 2 environment. We will cover the following topics:

-   **Creating a ROS 2 Node in Python:** Learn how to create a new ROS 2 node using `rclpy`.
-   **Publishing and Subscribing to Topics:** Learn how to send and receive messages on ROS 2 topics using `rclpy`.
-   **Creating a Simple Agent:** We will create a simple agent that subscribes to sensor data and publishes control commands.
