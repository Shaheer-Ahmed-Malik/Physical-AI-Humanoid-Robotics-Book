# Humanoid Modeling with URDF

The Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) is an XML format for representing a robot model. URDF is used to describe the physical properties of a robot, such as its links, joints, and sensors.

In this section, we will learn how to use URDF to create a model of a humanoid robot. We will cover the following topics:

-   **URDF Basics:** Learn the basic syntax of URDF and how to create a simple robot model.
-   **Links and Joints:** Learn how to define the links and joints of a robot in URDF.
-   **Sensors and Actuators:** Learn how to add sensors and actuators to a URDF model.
-   **Visualizing a URDF Model:** Learn how to visualize a URDF model in RViz.
