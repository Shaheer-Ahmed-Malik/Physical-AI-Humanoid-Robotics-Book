# Capstone Project: Autonomous Humanoid

Welcome to the capstone project! In this section, we will bring together all the concepts and technologies learned throughout the book to build a fully autonomous simulated humanoid robot. This project will serve as a practical demonstration of Physical AI, embodied intelligence, and advanced robotics integration.

Our goal is to create a simulated humanoid that can:

-   **Receive a spoken command:** Utilizing VLA capabilities to interpret high-level instructions from a human.
-   **Plan a navigation route:** Using Nav2 to autonomously navigate its environment.
-   **Use perception to identify an object:** Leveraging Isaac ROS and sensor simulation to detect and recognize objects.
-   **Manipulate the object in the environment:** Executing actions to interact with and manipulate objects.

This capstone project will provide a hands-on experience, guiding you through the process of integrating perception, cognitive planning, and action execution in a simulated humanoid robot.
