## Prompt

Continue with the next task.

## Response snapshot

I successfully expanded the `capstone/code.md` file and marked the corresponding task as complete.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The `capstone/code.md` file was expanded with detailed instructions and code snippets, contributing to the overall goal of reaching 80,000 words for the book.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: 2 files modified
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with the next chapter expansion task.
- 🧠 Reflection: Continuing with the tasks in sequence is a good approach.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `create-phr.sh` script failed due to `bash` not being available on the Windows environment.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): null
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Use a PowerShell script for creating PHRs on Windows to improve reliability.
