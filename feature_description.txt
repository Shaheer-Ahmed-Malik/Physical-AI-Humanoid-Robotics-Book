Title: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Purpose: Create an accessible yet professional book that teaches Physical AI, embodied intelligence, humanoid robotics, simulation, and AI-robot integration using ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac. Audience: - Beginners to intermediate learners in AI, robotics, or computer science - Students transitioning from digital AI to embodied intelligence - Readers interested in humanoid robots, control systems, and VLA (Vision-Language-Action) Scope: - Explain Physical AI and embodied intelligence in simple terms - Bridge the gap between AI (the “brain”) and robotics (the “body”) - Show how humanoid robots perceive, plan, act, and interact with humans - Cover simulation, digital twins, perception, control, and conversational robotics Content Structure (Modules → Chapters): 1. The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Nodes, topics, services, actions - Python agents connected to ROS controllers via rclpy - URDF for humanoid modeling 2. The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Physics simulation, collisions, gravity - High-fidelity rendering, robotics environments - Sensor simulation: LiDAR, RGB-D, IMUs 3. The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) - Isaac Sim for photorealistic training - Isaac ROS: VSLAM, navigation, depth perception - Nav2 for bipedal movement and path planning 4. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Whisper for voice-to-action - LLM-based cognitive planning (“Clean the room → action sequence”) - Multi-step reasoning for robotics tasks Capstone: - A fully autonomous simulated humanoid that: - Receives a spoken command - Plans a navigation route - Uses perception to identify an object - Manipulates the object in the environment Learning Outcomes: - Understand Physical AI & embodied intelligence - Master ROS 2 fundamentals - Simulate humanoids in Gazebo and Unity - Use NVIDIA Isaac for perception and training - Integrate LLMs for conversational robotics - Build real or simulated humanoid control pipelines Hardware Requirements (for. readers or labs that follow hands-on): - Workstation with RTX 4070 Ti+ (or cloud alternative) - Jetson Orin Nano/NX - Intel RealSense D435i/D455 - Optional robots: Unitree Go2, Robotis OP3, Unitree G1 Format: - 10–14 chapters - Written in MDX for Docusaurus - Visuals stored in /static/img/ - GitHub Pages deployment Style Requirements: - Professional but easy-to-read tone - Short paragraphs, clear examples, analogies - Accurate robotics and AI explanations with verified sources - No unnecessary jargon; concepts must be simplified where possible Constraints: - Total length: 25,000–40,000 words - Every chapter includes summary + learning objectives - Diagrams for system architecture, pipelines, and robot functions Success Criteria: - Reader gains a working understanding of Physical AI - Smooth Docusaurus build & GitHub Pages deployment - Content is technically correct, engaging, and accessible - Clear progression from fundamentals → simulation → AI → humanoid robotics → VLA
